Dear Ruben and Manuel,
attached you will find a set of 6 different mirrors measured at our lab.
I`ve tried to select different type of mirrors made for different application and for different energy ranges.
I hope you can read the data ?
All files show the “absolute” data, no fit is applied.
When you open the files with an editor you will find a header at the begin of each file which gives some information on the mirror. I think it is useful to have this information e.g. requirements for hard X-ray optics will be different compared to UV and VUV-optics.
In the header you will also find the design parameter e.g. of the ellipses or parabola.
I have asked all the responsible persons of the beamlines at the different facilities to agree on placing the data at your library and they all gave an OK.
We should thank them somehow.
If you have questions on all this – please do not hesitate to ask me
 
Best wishes from Berlin + have a nice weekend
Frank
