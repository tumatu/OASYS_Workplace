I'm attaching an ASCII file with data from an 880mm / 1.5" Internally Cooled Silicon Mirror.  It has a clear aperture of 775mm / 0.55".  There are 0.5mm bevels all the way around the optic.  The data is calibrated in the tangential (X) direction only.  This file will run in Metropro if you want to take a quick look at it.
