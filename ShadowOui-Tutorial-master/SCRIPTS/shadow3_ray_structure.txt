Shadow Ray structure

  1  - position x in user units
  2  - position y in user units
  3  - position z in user units
  4  - director cosine x (approx angle x' in rad)
  5  - director cosine y 
  6  - director cosine z (approx angle z' in rad)
  7  - electric field s-polarized Es_x
  8  - electric field s-polarized Es_y
  9  - electric field s-polarized Es_z
  10 - flag: 1.0 the ray is good, <1 the ray is lost
  11 - wavevector modulus: 2 pi / lambda
  12 - ray index (starting from 1.0)
  13 - optical path, in user units
  14 - s-polarized phase Es_phi
  15 - p-polarized phase Ep_phi
  16 - electric field p-polarized Ep_x
  17 - electric field p-polarized Ep_y
  18 - electric field p-polarized Ep_z
